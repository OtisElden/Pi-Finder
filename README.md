Currently a work in progress. The idea behind the project was to take PI, calculate it out to find a sequence of numbers and then return that index. Mostly a neat party trick. Little did I know that party trick would require math so deep and unrecognisable it should be considered magic. Will hopefully come back to this when I either learn that math needed or someone calculates PI out to like the billionoth digit.
